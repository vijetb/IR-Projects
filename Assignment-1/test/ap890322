   The FBI may withhold from public disclosure its
``rap sheets'' on some 24 million Americans, the Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday.
   The court, in a broadly worded opinion, said a federal law aimed
at curtailing government secrecy does not require the FBI or any
other agency to release information about private citizens.
   The 9-0 decision scuttled a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by
a CBS News reporter and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press aimed at obtaining such documents.
   The 1966 law allows government agencies to withhold documents
when disclosure ``could reasonably be expected to constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said a
government agency supplying someone with information about private
citizens virtually always is an unwarranted invasion of privacy.
   ``The FOIA's central purpose is to ensure that the government's
activities be opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny, not that
information about private citizens that happens to be in the
warehouse of the government be so disclosed,'' Stevens said.
   The FBI maintains millions of identification records, called rap
sheets, detailing arrest and conviction information supplied by
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
   CBS correspondent Robert Schakne in 1978 sought all FBI records
of the arrests, indictments and court dispositions of any charges
against four brothers, two of whom later were identified by
authorities as associates of reputed Pennsylvania crime boss Russell
Bufalino.
   Filed under the FOIA, the request in dispute sought such
information about Charles Medico, one of the four brothers.
   Schakne said he was trying to determine if Medico had a criminal
record because the brothers' firm, Medico Industries Inc., had
received lucrative defense contracts with the help of former Rep.
Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa.
   Schakne said he requested the FBI files as part of his reporting
on Flood, who had been charged with accepting $50,000 in bribes.
Flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on
probation.
   The Reporters Committee later filed a similar request.
   A federal appeals court here rejected Justice Department
arguments that such FBI records are covered by privacy exceptions in
the FOIA but Wednesday's ruling said the government's interpretation
of the 1966 law is correct.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William J. Brennan said the court
went too far in exempting all rap-sheet information from FOIA
disclosure.
   ``I ... would leave the door open for the disclosure of rap-sheet
information in some circumstances,'' Blackmun wrote in a concurring
opinion joined by Brennan.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., praised the ruling as a ``pro-privacy
decision, adding, ``It is important that the coEdwards, who chairs a House
subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights, said, ``The court reaffirmed the individual's
right to privacy in information held by the government. I do not see
this as an anti-FOIA decision ... The information is still available
to the press at the local level.''
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously that the composition of New York City's
powerful Board of Estimate violates the equal-voting rights of the
city's more populous boroughs. On the board are the mayor, the city
council president and the city comptroller, with two votes apiece,
and the presidents of the city's five boroughs, with one vote apiece.
   _Expanded the sweep of federal mail fraud law as it upheld, 5-4,
the conviction of an Illinois man who sold used cars in Wisconsin
after tampering with their odometers.
   _Voted 8-1 in a West Virginia case to limit the federal
government's tax bite in some business mergers.
